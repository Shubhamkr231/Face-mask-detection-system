WHAT-:

1. It is a computer vision Application which can detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not and then store their data who are not wearing the mask.
2. This Application can get data from various sources such as IP Camera,WebCam,Online video.
3. This is a web Application which can be accessed over a LAN.
4. The IP camera is a wireless surveillance camera which can send footage to the wifi network to which it is connected then if the computer which contains the application is also connected with the same wifi network , then we will be able to work on that footage data into our project and detect the mask.

WHY-:

1. This Application can be used in many places such as hospitals,Research Labs,Polluted Areas,Airborne Pandemic.
2. This kind of project shows the machine Learning knowledge,programming skills and Web Development
skills which can be very useful for a resume.
3. This kind of project shows you can solve real world problems with your knowledge.


HOW-:

1.Backend Connection with IP Camera: OpenCV  Face Detection : OpenCV
Mask Detection : Keras,numpy
Save Data : OpenCV
2. Frontend Web Application : Streamlit
